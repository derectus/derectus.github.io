I'm application security & software development enthusiast. I have been providing software consultancy to small and medium-sized companies for a few years.
Generally, I work on the backend technologies. The technologies i use are usually PHP -laravel, symfony-, Python -Django, Flask- and Java (Spring Boot).
Also, I work as a translator and writer in the [Arka Kapı Magazine](https://arkakapidergi.com/).
